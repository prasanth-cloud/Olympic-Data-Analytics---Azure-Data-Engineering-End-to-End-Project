# Olympic-Data-Analytics---Azure-Data-Engineering-End-to-End-Project
In this project, we will be using the various Azure data services which are used for Data Ingestion, Transformation and loading . The services are Azure Datafactory, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2(ADLS), Azure synapse analytics and Power BI.
## Project Overview
Here, we are extracting the data from an external data source using a service in azure called as Azure Datafactory, which is used to create piplines and to provide connection using various external sources. After making the connection, we will store the data in ADLS . Then we will perform the transformation by cleaning the data, removing the duplicates, and changing the datatypes according to the source file.


The transformed data has been then stored in another container in ADLS and move the data to Azure synapse analytics for analysis. In synapse analytics , we do query processing to find out the required insights from the data.


Finally, we will prepare the dashboard using power BI, or Looker Studio or Tableau.
